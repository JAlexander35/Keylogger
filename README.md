# Basic Keylogger (using Python)
Just a script that logs user input via keyboard strokes as well as annotate the date/time that the key was pressed. The entire script is only 12 lines long - short, yet effective. A keylogger programâ€™s basic functionality is to monitor keystrokes continuously and then deliver those keystrokes to a specific location that can be either an email, server, or stored locally in the system - acting as a form of spyware. Its a dangerous tool, as in if someone was able to breach and remotely run this script on your computer, they could potentially obtain passwords, SSNs,credit card information, etc.

I used VSCode for my IDE. For the script to work, you need to install the pynput library which contains 2 sub-packages that are utilized to detect mouse and keyboard input devices. 

Once the Python script is executed, it listens in on any keystroks and logs that data to the output file. I chose it to to output to a notepad file saved locally on my (C:) drive for ease of demonstration. You can discern the little messages I typed blindly while running a exercise of its functionality - in the PNG image above says "hi there". An important thing to note is that non-alphanumberic or symbol keys spells out the key you press, such as *space bar* and *shift*. Can you tell the what the message in the below says?

*With this exercise, I did not participate nor do I condone to the use of keyloggers for illegal purpsoses. And neither should you. : )*
